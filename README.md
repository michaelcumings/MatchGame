Clicky Game

This is a game to test memory, based on cards from the game Android: Netrunner.
There are 12 cards, and every time the user clicks one, the cards are mixed.  Each
time the user chooses a card that he or she hasn't chosen this game, the score increments
by one, and if that surpasses the high score, the high score increments by one.
